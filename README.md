List of 8 seeds and their sister seeds containing a Surface Exposed Stronghold with a 12 eye

# INFO
- In 1.17, some Strongholds would generate higher then their 1.16.1 counterparts. But they would now generate with a bunker covering most of the strongholds. Some Stone Bricks would still be exposed though.
- This is only including seeds with a visible bunker on the surface. Some seeds will not have any Stone Bricks visible.
- That last point was sort of a lie because if some terrain (usually y 70+) gets in the way. The bunker would not be visible because it is covered by terrain. Attatched below is some seeds with not much terrain covering the strongholds causing some pretty visible bunkers and exposed Stone Bricks.
